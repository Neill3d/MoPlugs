# MoPlugs
MotionBuilder Extensions Pack

## MoRenderer ##

 I'm using many nvidia extensions, so to make the morenderer work properly, you should have nVidia card (with gpu chipset Kepler or later)

## Dependencies ##

 There are several projects that I'm using in MoPlugs.

### glew ###

### glm ###

### NVFX ###

 I like that project a lot. Very powerful, and it's a pity that Tristan stops updating it. That's what OpenGL was missing - to have a flexible and powerful effect system.
 I'm using nvFX statis libraries with some small modifications, you can find it in my repositories. 
 
### OpenColor IO ###

 That extension is used by Composition Effect (3d LUT's)
 
### Newton Physics Engine ###

### rapidjson and Streetview-Explorer ###

 That libraries are used by CubeMap from street view functionality.
