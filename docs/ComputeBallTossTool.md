Compute Ball Toss Tool Script
For Autodesk MotionBuilder 2014

## Description
 
 Ball should have a computed movement trajectory (plotted parent/child from a hand joint)
You should define start and stop frame, then maximum height for toss and press Do it!

 Toss will have a time scaling according to a defined range. If height is not too big and
time range is wide, the toss movement will slow down to have a correct trajectory.

 Script make a gap for X and Z curves and compute toss in Y.
