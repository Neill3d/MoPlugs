## How to Install ##

I have a very useful application to configurate motionbuilder startup paths for plugins and scripts - [ConfigApp](ConfigApp.md)

You have to clone a repository on your computer or just download a zip copy, then specify startup paths for plugins and scripts accroding to your motionbuilder version (plugins_2017 for motionbuilder 2017, etc.)

Scripts startup folders are:
- Lib
- Startup
- Startup_Physics (optional)

## Hardware requirenments ##

 I'm using many nvidia extensions, so to make the morenderer work properly, you should have nVidia card (with gpu chipset Kepler or later)
